# LongLongURL - longlongurl.pythonanywhere.com
 A URL Converter written in Python using Flask

 Reddit doesn't like URL converting services, and I don't like that.
 
 So in order to bypass this (and to have fun doing it), I just made my own rather \
 than look for a barely used service that isn't on Reddit's whitelist.

# How to use
 [1] Go to longlongurl.pythonanywhere.com\
 [2] Enter a URL you want converted\
 [3] Copy and use the newly converted LongLongURL

# How to use on Local Machine
 [1] Open terminal or powershell\
 [2] Run ```python backend.py``` or ```python3 backend.py```
